# Machine Learning Piscine

> ***Summary : This is Machine Learning Piscine(Bootcamp) created by the Paris-based student organization 42AI.***

| Module |             Title              |                         Description                          |
| :----: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   00   | Stepping into Machine Learning | You will start by reviewing some linear algebra and statistics.<br/> Then you will implement your first model and learn how to evaluate its performances. |
|   01   |  Univariate Linear Regression  | Today you will implement a method to improve your modelâ€™s performance: gradient descent.<br/> Then you will discover the notion of normalization. |
|   02   | Multivariate Linear Regression | Building on what you did on the previous modules you will extend the linear regression to handle more than one features.<br/> Then you will see how to build polynomial models and how to detect overfitting. |
|   03   |      Logistic Regression       | Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression.<br/> You will learn its loss function, gradient descent and some metrics to evaluate its performance. |
|   04   |         Regularization         | Today you will fight overfitting! You will discover the concepts of regularization<br/> and how to implement it into the algortihms you already saw until now. |
